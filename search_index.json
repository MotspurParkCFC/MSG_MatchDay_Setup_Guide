This guide covers everything you could possibly need to know! All keys are stored inside MSG. We therefore recommend that individuals setting up or packing away park their vehicle outside of MSG, preferably near the Hillcross Avenue Alleyway. Please make sure that you wear the Orange “Match Day Supervisor” Hi-Vis for the duration of the day in case coaches or parents need to speak to you. If you are Opening Up please proceed to the next chapter otherwise please proceed to Chapter 5 Locking Up. "],["checking-the-pitches.html", "Chapter 1 Checking the Pitches", " Chapter 1 Checking the Pitches Before games can go ahead the pitches need to be assessed for suitability. We aim to have all pitches checked by 0800 so that opposition teams are given sufficient notice. We appreciate that everyone wants to get their games played, especially if there is a fixture backlog, you have a full squad that weekend, or the logistics of reversing the fixture are challenging, but it is important that we consider the longer term implications of playing which can result in more games being called off in the future and a significant cost in terms of money and time to reinstate the pitches mid season of renovate them at the end of the season. Things that we look for include: Is the pitch covered in snow or frost? If not, has the weather been cold enough to freeze the ground? Is the ground frozen or frozen below the top inch? Is there any standing water anywhere on the pitch? When walking on the pitch do you draw water up from underfoot? When moving your foot does the surface smear? Is playing likely to compact the surface? Is the weather for the day likely to contribute to any of the above occurring during play? Can we get away with playing the first game but none after that? If you’re not sure. Then it’s a no go!

Make sure that all padlocks are snapped shut and not left hanging. 2.1 Accessing the Keys All keys are stored inside MSG. We therefore recommend that individuals setting up or packing away park their vehicle outside of MSG, preferably near the Hillcross Avenue Alleyway. Enter MSG. The code for the padlock on the Red Pedestrian Gate can be found within the Master Lock app. Open the App Click on the MSG Pedestrian Gate option. The padlock code can be viewed in the Notes section. Proceed through the compound towards the Dark Green Metal Storage Container. On the left hand side is a lock-box. This lock-box contains the Storage Container keys. Open the Master Lock app. Press the circle button on the lock-box to wake the lock-box up. A blue icon will appear next to the MSG Container Lockbox item. Press this to open the lockbox. Take the keys out and close the lock-box. Leave the compound. Only leave the gate open if the 11-aside pitch is being used.

If you need goal spares, away kits, extra bin bags or linesman flags these can be found within the front left hand container as you look towards the compound. If you need top dressing this can be found in the Dark Green Metal Container located within the compound. 3.1 Match Day Equipment Using the keys open up the front left container as you look towards the compound. The Red key opens the storage container handle padlock. The Defender key opens the storage container lockbox padlock. MAKE SURE THAT BOT PADLOCKS ARE LOCKED SHUT. Inside this storage container is the Orange Hi-Vis – please put this on. You will also find a lock-box located inside which contains the vehicle entrance access keys. Open the Master Lock app. Press the circle button on the lock-box to wake the lock-box up. A blue icon will appear next to the MSG Vehicle Access Lockbox item. Press this to open the lockbox. Take the keys out and close the lock-box. This contains contains all of the s 3.2 Vehicle Access Walk down towards the vehicle entrance. Use the IFAM key to unlock the white fate. The white gate will need to be locked open. Use the electronic fob (number 1) to open up the black vehicle access gate. Once it is nearly fully open press it again to lock it in place. Unlock the parking sign from the pole using the code stored within the notes section. Open the Master Lock App. Click on the MSG Parking Sign padlock. The code will be stored in the Notes section. Make sure that the padlock is locked back on the pole. The red sign goes outside of the black gate in the middle of the road, with enough space to drive around it, but designed to prevent people driving in. 3.3 Signage There are three blue stanchion signs. These need to be placed at each prominent entrance. One by the coaches and officials car park (near the tennis courts) and the other two by each entrance located in the corners of the top of the field. There are two slalom poles with signs saying no access to pitches. These need to be placed by the leisure centre on the field boundary to stop people walking across the field. The plastic orange fencing needs to be pinned with the metal stakes and cable tied to the gap in the fencing to deter people from returning to the car park through the field (or we get grumpy emails from the leisure centre). The metal A-frame sign next to the container needs to be taken out and placed on the hard standing area near the old cricket nets so that anyone entering through the Hillcross entrance sees it (This is more for the other MSG stakeholders). There are black sacks on the shelving in the same container as the bins. These need to go into each bin with a litter picker placed inside. Leave these in the compound so that someone from each pitch can take them out. There is no defib kept on site at MSG. I take this to the venue every week so will give it to whomever has the keys. Please leave it in the lockup so that it is accessible and take it home with you when done as cold weather destroys the batteries. Please walk around all pitches and check that all portable goals have their back bars clipped in and pegged down. Coaches should be checking this but they don’t. Pay any referees before they KO. They need to sign the sheet and be given the envelope with their name on. Which pitch the Veo will be on will be announced on the Zulip Matchday Info channel. The tripod is in the storage container and there are three pegs hanging on it. The Veo needs to be set up on the relevant pitch. There are instructions in the box. I would try to hand responsibility of this over to the first team on the pitch.
